How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can see which lines are different from previous version. Can spot mistake faster.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Save more time, not having to go through the whole file to find any mistake.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I have the control of when to commit and tag a version of my source. I might be 
	accidentally committing wrong stuff to version control which I don't need.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The committed file might be interalated to each other, while google doc doesn't allow
	manual saving, and there is unlikely having file that are interelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Check the + and - sign to see the changes in different version.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easily find mistake made in previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Store my personal project history changes in git.
