When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- Done.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	- we might not want to get some of the changes on git hub while we working on something locally.
	
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- forks: copy other's repository to your own repository if it is set to as public by the owner.
	- clones: copy repository to your local machine.
	- branches: copy repository to a new path, allowing you to create, modify or remove things without 
	affecting the master repository.
