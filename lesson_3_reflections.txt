When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- Done.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	- we might not want to get some of the changes on git hub while we working on something locally.
	
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- forks: copy other's repository to your own repository if it is set to as public by the owner.
	- clones: copy repository to your local machine.
	- branches: copy repository to a new path, allowing you to create, modify or remove things without 
	affecting the master repository.
	
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	- so that we can see if there is any conflict that we need to resolve before we commit 
	the new merge.
	
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	- I will need to copy the changes from other collaborator at a separate folder on my machine,
	use win merge to compare the changes. Merge them manually and keep another copy of it as updated
	version.
	- using github is easier, but svn is even more easy to use.
	
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

	- when I've something that I want to test it out, before any code review.
	- so that it wouldn't affect the master, which will affects other users.
